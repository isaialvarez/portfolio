# Isai's Portfolio

Hello, welcome to my portfolio, here you will find my solution to some algorithms and small projects I developed for fun.

## Sorting algorithms
1. Selection sort

## Other algorithms
1. Find the Symetric Difference
   The mathematical term symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both.
3. No Repeats
   Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters. 
5. Pairwise
   Given an array arr, find element pairs whose sum equal the second argument arg and return the sum of their indices.
